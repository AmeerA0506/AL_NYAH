L02 -- Creating an OrderedArrayList
2021-12-11
Time Spent: 2.5 hours
DISCOS:
* use <gang signs>
* you can iterate through ArrayList using a for each loop - ArrayList is iterable
* you need to import java.util.ArrayList before using ArrayLists

QCC:
* How can we make an object iterable?
* How can we make our code more Robust?
* We are currently running into an issue with the binary search, how much quicker is the binary search implementation?
